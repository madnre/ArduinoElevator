Title: Arduino Uno Elevator Simulator

Description: Our Arduino Uno Elevator Simulator project showcases the functionality of a real-world elevator system using an Arduino Uno microcontroller board. Complete with a button interface for floor selection and indicator lights to display the elevator cabin's position, the project demonstrates the Arduino Uno's efficiency in managing complex systems. With motor control for movement and real-time operation, the simulator serves as an educational tool for understanding elevator operation principles and microcontroller programming.
